I'm currently a Computer Science master's student specializing in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, which I anticipate to complete in December 2024. I graduated from Georgia Tech in December 2023 with a bachelor's in Computer Science concentrating in Intelligence and Information Internetworks.

I've recently been interested in computer vision and its applications. I developed a tool in Python that can automatically create football playcards given the video of a football play. Additionally, I am currently involved in research at the Margulies Injury Biomechanics Laboratory at Emory University where we use convolutional neural networks to detect blood-brain barrier leakages after brain injury. 

Professionally, I spent two summers interning at Capital One building applications for internal use. I also spent a summer interning at CDK Global where I helped move their main application to a CI/CD pipeline by hosting the application on Docker containers. I also completed a project for research with Tufts Medical Center where I built a web application that allowed cardiologists to evaluate patient images to see if a type of cardiac disorder could be predicted.

# Notable Projects

## [Football 3D Reconstruction](https://pranav-datta.github.io/Football-3D-Reconstruction/)

![Football play with bounding boxes around each player](/images/football.png)

This was a project in my CS 6476 Computer Vision class where we developed a method for reconstructing football plays in Unity so that the play could be viewed from any angle. We used a neural network trained on football players to get player positions *ADD TRACKING STUFF*. For the homography of these positions to our virtual field, we used blob detection and Hough Line Transform to detect interest points on the field.
